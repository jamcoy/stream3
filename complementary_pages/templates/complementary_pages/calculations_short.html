    <span class="embedded-logo">EasyFuelTracker</span> calculates your vehicle's fuel economy using the
    brim-to-brim method.
<p>
    Partial tanks are included in the calculations if you don't miss logging anything.
</p>
<p>
    If you miss logging any refuels, your latest refuel and all preceding refuels to the previous full tank
    are excluded.

    For further details, please refer to your refueling history.
